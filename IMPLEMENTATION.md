## üéØ Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between frontend, backend, and AI service
- **Modular Components**: Each React component is self-contained and reusable
- **RESTful API**: Standard HTTP methods for predictable endpoints
- **Environment Configuration**: Easy deployment to different environments

### AI Integration
- **Dual Mode Operation**: Works with or without OpenAI API key
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to simulated responses if API fails
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation history for coherent dialogues
- **Token Optimization**: Limits history to prevent excessive token usage

### User Experience
- **Instant Feedback**: Loading states and typing indicators
- **Quick Actions**: Pre-defined prompts for common queries
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information prominently displayed
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices

## üìä Demo Data

The application includes a demo employee profile:

```javascript
{
  id: 'emp001',
  name: 'Alex Johnson',
  role: 'Software Engineer',
  department: 'Engineering',
  goals: [
    'Lead a major feature development',
    'Mentor 2 junior engineers',
    'Improve system performance by 20%'
  ],
  skills: ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node.js', 'System Design', 'Team Leadership'],
  performance: {
    score: 87,
    achievements: [
      'Reduced API response time by 35%',
      'Successfully mentored 2 interns',
      'Led the Q3 feature rollout'
    ]
  }
}
```

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

2. **Configure environment (optional):**
   - Add OpenAI API key to `.env` file
   - Works in demo mode without API key

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

## üîÑ Workflow

### User Interaction Flow
1. Employee logs into dashboard (simulated with hardcoded employee ID)
2. Dashboard loads employee data and displays cards
3. AI chatbot initializes with employee context
4. Employee can:
   - Chat with AI for guidance
   - Use quick prompts for common questions
   - Request comprehensive alignment analysis
   - Clear chat history to start fresh

### Data Flow
1. **Frontend** sends API request to backend
2. **Backend** processes request and calls AI service
3. **AI Service** generates response (OpenAI or simulated)
4. **Backend** returns formatted response
5. **Frontend** displays response with animations

## üé® Design Philosophy

### Visual Design
- **Professional**: Corporate-friendly color scheme
- **Modern**: Gradients, shadows, and smooth animations
